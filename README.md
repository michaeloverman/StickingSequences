# StickingSequences
a simple program to generate four-mallet marimba sticking combinations.

This was one of my very first, small coding projects, which I created when I was just learning Java, sometime around 1998. The goal was to create all of the combinations of various marimba stickings one can play, using four mallets. So essentially this program "counts" all the possible combinations, sort of like counting base 4. It then also delineates a couple subsets: combinations which use each mallet at least once (1324 - yes, 1334 - no), and combinations which are unique, considering rhythmic displacement possibilities (2341 is the same as 1234 displaced by one stroke). And lastly, it generates the subset of both of these - unique combinations which use all four mallets.
This program recently became a wonderful, personal demonstration of how computers have developed over the past nearly 20 years. When I first created the program, I was surprised at how long it took to run. (It's not particularly efficient....) The first time I tried to create combinations of six strokes, I ended up stopping the run after a couple hours, only to discover that it had indeed been working just fine. It just took that long. I ran the program overnight to make the set of 7-stroke combinations. Recently (September 2016) I found a hard copy of my code, and recreated the program. Once I was sure it was working properly, I ran the set of 7-stroke combinations again, and it took less than one minute!
